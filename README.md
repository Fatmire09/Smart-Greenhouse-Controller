# Smart-Greenhouse-Controller
Intoducing the "Smart Greenhouse": an Arduino based system designed to automatically monitor environmental conditions and react accordingly. 
It controls irrigation, ventilation and user feedback by combining soil moisture sensing, temperature and humidity monitoring, a water pump, a stepper driven greenhouse door, an LCD display and RGB LED indicators.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how embedded systems can be used to automate real world agricultural processes using a combination of sensors and non-blocking logic.
